30/12/2022, 07:35 - W2W3: Without a precedence in situation to draw from I chose one blueprint on the familiar ground of the Saturday Principal inspection scenario when every house master is in cohort with the College Principal in lead from hostel to hostel,  the head boy and head girl preemptive with each house captain, from room to room, doing   *roll call* 
It's every student in attendance complete with school badged pocket,  bucket,  blanket, pillow,  white socks, manicured finger nails 
My point is how every chips in to prepare the unprepared with a clean shirt and badge, a spare bucket, pillow case etc until every single person stands before *Oniko* 
Let's say someone lost their washing to the stormy night wind or maybe lost their brother unexpectedly 
So now in solidarity I pass a collection facility around in support, upgraded from just pitiful sympathy in dignified stance, transparent by default, all together , what you will how it suits you... I prepared a suitable vessel strong in purpose. Your welcome to improve on process and design.

the old testament smells like a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye, right?
and the new? begins and end with jesus christ's mathew mark luke and john, right?
scolars and sunday school students will immediately concur with St Peters letters by extension as the act of the apostles, right? [you of such bible studying traditional knowledge]

this is the here and now with me Waksmimillian who says 
	LOVE 
		love is not a testament, testimony or testification
		love is the entire manifest, not at the core, not the kernel, not the cust
		love is the seed, the rooted in fertility at heart, the trunk as follows above ground, the branching seen as branches time after time after time in evidence, the power of growth, the green leaf in sunshine at the apex, the shade below that shelters, the heat, intensity, the noun of the verbal in plain sight
		love is the generator of every single lesson, the endpoint of everything to be learnt, the eureka, the epiphany, the light no brighter now that it was then, the light no different from heat felt as comfort, the light in comfortable abundance shared, the light enough for one and all, the light all together the same as before seen to be everlasting, truoly clear without ration
		in the light of truth felt is a shared realisation in the scriptures only work to be done is show what is already there need not be cause of this unhappiness being undone
		in your preaching of this unconditional love, be one that is true to your own self and of duty in the foremost be first to enjoy the fruit of it all before laying eyes at all upon whosoever be of interest in the second degree be to you a third party
		with your own life is said everthing words will fall short of saying to your neighbour who will ask what changes they perceive in you that will be so good in the light that shinesd so they want and ask of you the what, where and how of which being a christian in mind be blinded with a heart filled field of your own starlight upon reflection from person to person by warmth 
		fiery passion, light of purity, revelation at heart,in fullness as light of day
		
		how can I teach the children? what they already know? reveal what they already see, share what they already have, give what they already have, free what is already in abundance? 
		in the rejoice event is evidence, rejoicing said in praise, the ordinary no longer, this life is by living it so full of joy in wonder
		your will rejoice, transcendent to enjoy, by plurality and self respectively; kind of like a bushfire
		in the living, in the here, in the now, in this very moment just reborn, again and again anad again, this testimonia unscripted and living as do scriptures alive
		given by the living in the breath of life, againn and again and again, by as many, in as many times, time and time again
		in the name of jesus christ our lord
		Amen
